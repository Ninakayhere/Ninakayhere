- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ninakayhere
- 👀 I’m interested in leaving the world and the community around me, better than how I first found it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning this platform, how to better communicate with people and am working on my personal brand. I'm in the self discovery 💡 mode after recently getting married and working at a startup.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on helping #Ukraine during this horrific war, as well as anything else that may be interesting!
- 📫 How to reach me ... Twitter? Email? LinkedIn? Snailmail?
